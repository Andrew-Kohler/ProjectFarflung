  - "MOON CENTRAL \r\nOFFICER OF THE LUNAR DIRECTOR\r\n3.604.9.24 - Date System Terra\r\n\r\nTo
    the chambers of the One Earth Council,\r\n\r\nI have requested this communication
    to be read publicly at your earliest convening. With any fortune, that means
    these words will be spoken into the latest interplanetary broadcast as soon as
    tomorrow.\r"
  - "I am writing to inform you, and the world, that the phenomenon of mounting disappearances
    plaguing Earth has shown its ugly face within Vaporum and Nectaris, our two shining
    lunar capitals.\r\n\r\nI say these words to you as a man without secrets; as
    a man who is always looking out for his people. No more can I keep this terrible
    truth from you than can I stop a ship bound beyond the light of our sun. I believe
    that sharing our knowledge, and using it to better ourselves, has always been
    the way forward.\r"
  - "At your discretion, I am requesting a full interplanetary quarantine. I ask
    that you devote as many resources as you can to purging this poison, whatever
    its true form is, from our veins, just as I am now across all lunar laboratories.
    I ask that everyone who hears this does their part to keep each other safe as
    we live among the stars, as we always have.\r\n\r\nI stare now from my office
    out onto the lunar surface, where stands an ageless flag. It reminds me that
    no matter the odds, humanity has never given up. Today is no different.\r"
  - "Yours,\r\nDr. Julian Capricorn\r\nLunar Director\r"
