  - "New Clues Emerge in Sibling Disappearance Case\r\n\r\nBy John Thompson\r\n\r\nNew
    ground has been broken this week in the investigation into the disappearance
    of sisters Chloe and Emma Langford. The girls, 7 and 10, were reported missing
    last week by their parents, reportedly vanishing out of the family\u2019s home
    in the late afternoon. The crime scene has been sealed off, but a dossier of
    evidence has recently been made available to the press.\r"
  - "\rIn a press conference accompanying the release of the evidence, the sheriff
    and detective assigned to the case urged the community to \u201Ckeep their eyes
    and ears wide open\u201D to help in the search, and made clear that their own
    investigation was still in its early stages. Notably, it was reported that the
    department recovered no genetic evidence from the scene of the crime. \r\nThis
    development is expected to hinder the forward progress of the investigation;
    with the advances made in biometric geolocation over the past 250 years, terrestrial
    missing persons cases have seen a 700% increase in the safe recovery of those
    missing.\r"
  - "Included in the dossier of evidence were some of the girls\u2019 personal items,
    the initial sworn statements of the mother and father, and a drawing quantum-analyzed
    by the New Indiana Territory forensics lab and confirmed to have the warmest
    remaining quantum heat print matching either of the sisters."
