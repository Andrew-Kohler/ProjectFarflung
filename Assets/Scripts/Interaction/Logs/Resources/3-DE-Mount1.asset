  - "Mac - \r\n\r\nResidential manager\u2019s been giving me a bad look every time
    I walk by. I fried my door lock so that the Do Not Disturb setting can\u2019t
    be bypassed by any of the keys on site, and printed a new one for you - it\u2019s
    hidden in the rec room. Make sure to be here tonight, I heard there\u2019s a
    peppermint shipment coming in. You remember where I live, right? First left north
    of the office.\r"
