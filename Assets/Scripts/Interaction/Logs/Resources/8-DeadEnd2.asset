  - "STARGAZER SYSTEMS\r\n\u201CAlways looking out\u201D\r\n\r\nSTARGAZER TERRESTRIAL
    EXPLORATION SUIT (STES) MANUAL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4 - HELMET DISPLAY\r\nNow that
    you\u2019re acquainted with the many locomotion-enhancing features of the STES,
    let\u2019s move on to using its intuitive heads up display, or HUD!\r"
  - "The default settings on the STES allow you to use the TAB key to switch between
    the HUD\u2019s information tabs. As with all controls on the STES, this can be
    customized, so remember which control you\u2019re using.\r\n\r\nThe STES HUD
    has three tabs:\r\n-The Home tab, which displays the time, helmet altitude, and
    results of continuous vital scanning. If a Stargazer flashlight is attached to
    the suit, the battery meter for the flashlight will also appear.\r"
  - "-The Map tab, which automatically fetches data from nearby Stargazer networks
    or its onboard geosensors to provide the most useful overview possible of the
    surrounding terrain. Use the ARROW KEYS to view additional information about
    your environment.\n\r\n-The File tab, an onboard file explorer application that
    allows the suit to record and retain data. Use the ARROW KEYS to browse, open,
    and close files. The STES has various input jacks on the user-left side of the
    helmet, and a document camera built into the external helmet bubble.\r"
  - The suit may provide additional information in debug mode for experienced or
    curious users; to learn about debug mode and how to turn it on and off, skip
    to chapter 7. Please note that in version 1.8.1 of the stesOS, a known malfunction
    leaves debug mode permanently enabled.
