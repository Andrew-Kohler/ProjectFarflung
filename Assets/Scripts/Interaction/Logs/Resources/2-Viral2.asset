    @ 2:56 AM - 189 Bebbups]\r\nit\u2019s just like those kids from NIT - it\u2019s
    super concerning that this kind of serial killer mindset is returning, and even
    more concerning that people are finding new ways to be effective at it\r\n\r"
  - "[REPLY by reevolvingTigersOnTheMoon @ 3:02 AM - 35 Bebbups]\r\nI\u2019m not
    even sure it\u2019s that. People are saying some mastermind is behind all this,
    or that \r\nthe parents are playing dumb, but I have a friend who got me some
    of the evidence. \r\nThose kids had to have been taken into a cult - the stuff
    they drew was too weird.\r\n\r\n[REPLY by qwerkyqwerty @ 3:11 AM  - 67 Bebbups]\r\ni
    have 18 kids and 5 are bioengineered. they do weird stuff, thats like the whole
    kid \r\nthing\r\n"
  - "[REPLY by reevolvingTigersOnTheMoon @ 3:15 AM  - 42 Bebbups]\r\nDude, you didn\u2019t
    see this thing. Imagine the Dellion-2 fossils, but human and\u2026hateful. \r\nThat\u2019s
    probably it - some cult nutjobs preaching to kids about extinct aliens they don\u2019t
    \r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n[REPLY by NessieWasPlutonian @ 3:22 AM  - 4 Bebbups]\r\nit\u2019s
    only natural. How far out have we gone and it\u2019s just been us? We wer bound
    to find a space cryptid sooner or l8tr. Kids probs saw it and got nightmares
    b4 it ate their souls or whatevs.\r"
  - "[REPLY by MOD SpicyMilk888 @ 3:23 AM  - 17 Bebbups]\r\nNessie, we\u2019re discussing
    missing children. Theories are fine, but have some class.\r\n\r\n[REPLY by qwerkyqwerty
    @ 3:34 AM  - 19 Bebbups]\r\ni changed my mind, im with nessie. space bigfoot
    is real and he eats you. gonna tell my kids\r\n"
