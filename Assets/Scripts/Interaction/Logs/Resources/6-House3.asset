  - "[Voice 1 - Leader 2 (Station Leader Pax)]\r\nRaevel?\r\n\r\n[Voice 2 - Leader
    1 (Station Leader Raevel - pronounced RAYVELL)]\r\nRaevel sounds tired; she\u2019s
    been staring at a screen for hours.\r\nHuh - Pax?\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nYeah, it\u2019s
    me.\r\n"
  - "A pause.\r\n\r\nAnything come through?\r\n\r\n[Raevel]\r\nNot yet. Just a few
    more minutes till the hour on Earth, though, so probably then.\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nPensively
    -\r\nRay\u2026I think I might have a solution.\r\n"
  - "[Raevel]\r\nHuh? Was something in one of the old files we got?\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nNo,
    no, it\u2026it\u2019s from the station schematics.\r\n\r\n[Raevel]\r\nExcited
    -\r\nYou\u2019re kidding. What, have we been sitting on a mineral it hates? Will
    it burn if we get it into the moon\u2019s atmosphere?\r"
  - "[Pax]\r\nRay, slow down. Please, just listen.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\nThe station\u2019s
    nuclear core can be overloaded pretty easily if we push it. Normally, that would
    lead to a station meltdown, but if we eject it-\r\n\r\n[Raevel, interrupting]\r\nWait,
    that\u2019s suicide! That thing would irradiate the base in minutes.\r"
  - "[Pax]\r\n- I\u2019m not done.If we eject it and deliver it across the station
    to the geothermal borehole, and then dump it, we can trigger a chain reaction
    in the planet\u2019s center. Nothing in the universe could survive being on this
    moon\u2019s surface when the inner core detonates. I\u2019ve run the calculations,
    we might even end up inducing a low-level supernova.\r\n\r\nAnother beat.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d
    kill it, Ray. No question.\r"
  - "[Raevel]\r\nA pause, then slowly-\r\nYou\u2019d kill\u2026us.\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nRay,
    we\u2019re already dead, there\u2019s no point in-\r\n\r\n[Raevel]\r\nFull of
    energy now, no longer asleep -\r\nYou\u2019d KILL US! That computer right there
    could give us an answer any minute and you\u2019d blow us all to hell instead?!\r\n"
  - "[Pax]\r\nRay, please, nothing\u2019s come through in-\r\n\r\n[Raevel]\r\nNO!
    [With vitriol] Station Leader Pax, you will stand down right now. That\u2019s
    an order.\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nNo, Station Leader Raevel, I will not. This is why
    I wanted Geller up here, I knew you wouldn't listen to me-\r"
  - "[Raevel]\r\nYou probably killed Geller just by telling him this! You know, what,
    no, you-\r\nBeeps and computer noises can be heard\r\n\r\n[Pax]\r\nRaeval, what
    are you- HEY!\r\nA scuffle can be heard.\r\n\r\n[Raevel]\r\nToo late. Deadlocked.
    You\u2019re stuck up here with me until something comes through. Sit down.\r\n"
  - '[Pax]

    You-you-AAUGH!

    A greater scuffle can be heard. It ends with
    a loud THUNK and the sound of a body collapsing to the floor.

    

    [Raevel]

    Breathing
    heavily-

    Get- get up, Pax.

    

    No response.

  - "Pax. Pax, get up. Sit down and wait, don\u2019t just- don\u2019t just lie there.\r\n\r\nNo
    response. Raevel now sounds worried.\r\n\r\nPax, get up. Pax.\r\n\r\nWe hear
    Raevel rush to, presumably, Pax\u2019s body.\r\n\r\nPax, get up. Pax. Pax!\r\n"
  - "\r\rA computer beep.\r\n\r\nH-huh?\r\n\r\nWe hear Raevel walking over to the
    computer and tapping through a transmission.\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, no, no! Nonononono\u2026\r\n"
  - "\rNo, no, no! We- we have that! We have so much! We could have - Pax, come read
    this - we could have -\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, no\u2026Pax, we could have won\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
    log trails off into sobbing.\r\n\n"
