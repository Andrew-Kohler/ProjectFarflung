  - "Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It\u2019s
    not a story the Jedi would tell you. It\u2019s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis
    was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to
    influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the
    dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. \n\nThe
    dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
    He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,
    which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
    everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could
    save others from death, but not himself."
  - 'Is it possible to learn this power?


    Not from a Jedi.'
